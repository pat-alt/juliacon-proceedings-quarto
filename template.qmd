# Introduction {#sec-intro}

*TODO* Create a template that demonstrates the appearance, formatting, layout, and functionality of your format. Learn more about journal formats at <https://quarto.org/docs/journals/>.

## Proof-of-Concept

This is a proof-of-concept for how we could use Quarto for JuliaCon proceedings. For current submissions, please ignore this repo and follow the official instructions [here](https://github.com/JuliaCon/JuliaConSubmission.jl).

## Code

```{.julia}
println("Hello, world!")
```
